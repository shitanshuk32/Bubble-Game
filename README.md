## How to Play

- When you start the game, you will see a grid of bubbles containing a number.
- Your objective is to click on the bubble that displays the same number as the "hit" number at the top.
- If you click the correct bubble, your score will increase.
- The "hit" number changes after each successful click, so stay sharp!
- The game ends when the timer reaches zero. You can then choose to play again.

## Features

- Randomly generated numbers in bubbles for added challenge.
- Keeps track of your score.
- Game over screen with the option to play again.

## What I Learned

While working on Bubble Game, I had the opportunity to explore and learn several key topics and technologies, including:

- Building web applications using Vite, a fast development build tool.
- Styling components using styled components for a clean and maintainable codebase.
- Managing state and user interactions in a React application.
- Implementing game logic for a simple yet engaging user experience.
- Best practices for organizing and structuring a web project.

I hope this project helps you learn and explore these topics as well. Enjoy playing Bubble Game!
